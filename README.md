# Scattering parameter extraction and optimization
`scatter_opt` is a MatLab package for processing electromagnetic scattering parameter data.

## Disclaimer
This is a package that I hastily developed to help a friend with a research project. I have not touched it since 2020. It has been tested reasonably thoroughly, but I cannot guarantee the results or provide full support! I am making it available in case it helps someone process their data and/or get started on their own code.

## Documentation
The "scatter-opt documentation" Word document walks through a fitting example and provides class and function documentation. In addition, the file fitting_examples_0408.m provides the code for the full fitting process with several different options shown. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to provide support for this package, but hopefully these examples will help you get started.

## Features
`scatter_opt` currently implements the following techniques:
* Nicholson-Ross-Weir (NRW) [1,2] and new non-iterative (NNI) [3] methods for permittivity and permeability extraction from S parameters
* Group delay method for branch selection as described by Weir [2]
* Kramers-Kronig method for branch selection as described by Szabó et al. [4]
* A new method for branch selection that is valid at high frequencies (unlike group delay) and does not suffer from truncation error (unlike the conventional Kramers-Kronig method)
* Nonlinear least-squares optimization of permittivity and permeability as described by  Domich, Baker-Jarvis, and Geyer [5,6]
